# Pokémon Memory Game

## Overview
The **Pokémon Memory Game** is a fun and interactive card matching game where players try to remember and match Pokémon cards. The goal is to click on cards without repeating any to earn points. The game keeps track of your current score and your highest score achieved during the game session.

This project is built using **React** and **JavaScript**, and it fetches Pokémon data from an external API to dynamically display the cards.

## Features
- **Dynamic Pokémon Cards**: The cards are fetched from an API and displayed in random order.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks your current score and highest score.
- **Card Shuffling**: The cards are shuffled after every click, so the game remains challenging.
- **Game Reset**: If you click on a card you've already clicked, the game resets the score to 0.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling the state of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and card designs.
- **Pokémon API**: Fetches Pokémon data (name, image, id) to display on the cards.
